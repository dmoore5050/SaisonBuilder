    Saison, or Farmhouse ale, is a style of beer native to the
Wallonia region of Belgium, and is know for its exceptional breadth
of style and its beautiful quenching character. Traditionally
brewed in the winter months and consumed during the summer months,
the Farmhouse Ale style is so known because they were commonly
brewed on the farm and given to seasonal workers laboring under
the summer sun due to their crisp, refreshing character.

    Because they were generally brewed with ingredients the farm
had on hand, there was a significant amount of variation in their
composition, with each farm producing a distinctive variation. As
a result, the modern saison style is uniquely broad, embracing a
wide array of ingredients, characters, and gravities. Lower gravity
saisons similar to those historically brewed are growing more
common, as are higher gravity 'winter' saisons. Unique ingredients
such as botanicals, fruit, spices, brettanomyces (a unique 'wild'
yeast), and even aging on woods such as oak and cedar are increasing
in frequency, both in the US and Belgium.

    The style's popularity has skyrocketed in recent years, pushed
by a number of breweries in both the US and Belgium brewing exclusively
saisons. Notable Saison can be found from Stillwater, Prairie, the
Bruery, and Southampton breweries in the US among many others, and from
Dupont, Fantome, Brasserie Thierez, and an array of others in Belgium
and France. Additionally, the Hopfenstark brewery in Montreal has
produced an array of unique saison variations built around the same
base recipe.
